                <p class="py-5">I'm a computer science student at Brigham Young University - Hawaii, and I will graduate with my bachelor's degree in December 2022. I will also graduate with minors in theatre and entrepreneurship. I live in Laie, HI with my husband Naleo.</p>
                <p class="py-5">I've loved computers as long as I can remember. I wrote my first program at the age of eleven, bought (and subsequently fried) my first Raspberry Pi at thirteen, and decided to make programming a lifelong pursuit at eighteen when I started college. Since then, I have learned all sorts of fun things! I've developed 3D games in Unity, made apps for both Android and iOS, and even wrote this website.</p>
                <p class="py-5">I have also had the opportunity to work as a TA and research assistant for the computer science department here at BYUH.</p>
