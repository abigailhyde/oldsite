    <h4>Ewoks</h4>
    <p>Ewoks are the funniest creatures! They're little, and fuzzy, and wear these little hoods. They live in a somewhat primitive society, though. I've never gotten to meet any, but I hope I can someday.</p>

    <h4>Porgs</h4>
    <p>My childhood best friend had a pet porg that we would take on walks around the capital city of Alderaan each afternoon. Since then I have always wanted one of my own, but there isn't much time to take care of a pet while trying to win a civil war. They have big, shiny eye and soft feathers. They look almost like the birds native to Alderaan, but have no beaks - instead, they have perpetually frowning mouths.</p>

    <h4>Bantha</h4>
    <p>Bantha may be my favorite creature in the entire galaxy. My favorite sweater is actually bantha hair, woven into a fine yarn. All ethically sourced, of course. They have big, curly horns, and live in herds with their families. Fun fact - you can tell how old a bantha is from how long its horns are. They are indigenous to the planet of Tatooine, where my hero Obi-Wan Kenobi lived before coming to save me and my friends from the Death Star. Go to the "Hero" tab to read more about him.</p>
