        <h1>Hello, my name is Leia Organa</h1>

        <p>I was born on Polis Massa in 19 BBY, but I was adopted shortly after. My adoptive parents made me the heiress of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Then, many years later, the Galactic Civil War began and I was captured by the Empire. Luckily, I recorded a message on a small droid named R2-D2 for General Kenobi, and then sent it to Tatooine to search for him - General Kenobi was my only hope, after all. I was then moved to the Death Star, and I became a prisoner there. After weeks of interrogation and being scheduled for execution, I was brought to a large window where I was forced to watch Darth Vader detroy my home planet of Alderaan.</p>

        <p>As all of this was happening, that droid I sent to Tatooine had found General Kenobi and some guy named Luke, a jedi in training. They traveled to the Death Star to find me, and together we worked to escape. We succeeded, but lost General Kenobi. I then assisted in the plan to destroy the Death Star using the information I had collected during my time as a prisoner.</p>
