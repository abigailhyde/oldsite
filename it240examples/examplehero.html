    <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi recently saved my from my imprisonment aboard the Death Star. He's awesome at combat and is an excellent strategist. Before coming to help me out, he was living on Tatooine, which is home to the Bantha species. To learn more about Banthas, check out my "Interests" page. Throughout my childhood, my parents told me stories of Kenobi's accomplishments. My father had been at Kenobi's side for many of these stories.</p>
